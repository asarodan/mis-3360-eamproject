# Systems Analysis and Design Team Project

## Project Description
This repository hosts a simple GitHub Pages site for a Management Information Systems team project. The site summarizes each project phase, tracks deliverables, and provides a consistent place to document diagrams, notes, and status updates.

## How to Use the Site
1. Open `index.html` in a browser for the project overview and phase navigation.
2. Visit each phase page in the `/phases` directory to document phase-specific content.
3. Place supporting files (documents, diagrams, exports) in the matching folder under `/deliverables`.
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages by selecting the main branch and root directory in the repository settings.

## Folder Structure
- `/index.html` and `/styles.css`: Homepage and shared styling.
- `/phases`: Phase detail pages (A–E).
- `/deliverables`: Placeholder folders for each phase deliverable set.
- `/assets`: Shared images or static files for the site.
